# vyAppar
vyAppar is an android app that brings together and connects SMEs with local customers and works on a proximity basis. The same was build by my friends and I for Aatmanirbhar Bharat Hackathon and went into the qualifiers round. The app has a Seller Feed, a market place, a proximity MapView, Filters, Search function and all sorts of authentications.
